## COVID 19 Data Exploration

## Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Aggregate Functions

-- Start with the data taken from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

SELECT *
FROM `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY 1, 2 

-- Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows the death rate of cases leading to death

SELECT
  location,
  date,
  total_cases,
  total_deaths,
  (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as death_percentage
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY
  1, 2
 
-- Looking at Total Cases vs Population
-- Shows what percentage of population got Covid

SELECT 
  location, 
  date, 
  population, 
  total_cases,  
  (total_cases/population)*100 as covid_percentage
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY
  1, 2

-- Looking at countries with highest infection rate compared to population

SELECT
  location,
  population,
  MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infection_count,
  MAX((total_cases/population))*100 as population_covid_percentage
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY population_covid_percentage desc 

-- Showing Countries with highest death count per population

SELECT
  location,
  MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infection_count,
  MAX(total_deaths) AS total_death_count,
  MAX((total_cases/population))*100 as population_covid_percentage,
  MAX((total_deaths/population))*100 as covid_death_percentage
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY total_death_count desc 

-- Broken down by continent sorted by highest death count per population

SELECT
  continent,
  MAX(total_deaths) AS total_death_count,
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY total_death_count desc 

-- Global Numbers sorted by Date
-- Shows the new cases and deaths broken down by day 

SELECT
  date,
  SUM(new_cases) as total_new_cases,
  SUM(new_deaths) AS total_new_deaths,
  SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS death_percentage,
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1, 2

-- Global Numbers Total

SELECT
  SUM(new_cases) as total_new_cases,
  SUM(new_deaths) AS total_new_deaths,
  SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS death_percentage,
FROM
  `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is not null 
ORDER BY 1, 2

-- Joining Covid Vaccine Table with Covid Death Table

SELECT *
FROM `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`death
JOIN `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_vaccinations` vacc 
    ON death.location = vacc.location
    AND death.date = vacc.date
    
-- Total Population vs Vaccination vs Cases

SELECT 
    death.continent,
    death.location, 
    death.date,
    death.population,
    death.total_cases,
    vacc.new_vaccinations,
    SUM(vacc.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION by death.location) AS total_country_vaccination
FROM `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_deaths`death
JOIN `sincere-cacao-323417.covid_dataset.covid_vaccinations` vacc 
    ON death.location = vacc.location
    AND death.date = vacc.date
WHERE death.continent is not null
ORDER BY 2, 3

-- Same table but with rolling vaccinations per day per country

SELECT 
    death.continent,
    death.location, 
    death.date,
    death.population,
    death.total_cases,
    vacc.new_vaccinations,

    ON death.location = vacc.location
    AND death.date = vacc.date
WHERE death.continent is not null
ORDER BY 2, 3

-- Utilize CTE to perform calculation on Partition By with previous query
